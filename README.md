# cloud-lightning

Forked from [molecule/cloud-lightning](https://github.com/molecule/cloud-lightning)

Original repo has a great [Full Instructable available here.](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-Lightning-Cloud/)

Changes:
- removed Bluetooth dependency
- adding randomness to switches between the single lightnings to the multiple ones.

Ran with 150 LEDs with satisfactory results, [as seen here](./example.mp4)
